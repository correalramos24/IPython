Pandas is the state-of-art library for manage datasets for data analysis in Python. This library works on the top of Numpy.

The basic unit is the **DataFrame**, which is a 2-Dimensional table composed of **series**; each serie is a 1-dimensional array of data and a label named index.

> is composed as the concat of this series.

The **records** of the **DataFrame** is a whole row, taking all the values from the series.
